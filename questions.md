1)class is a programming construct that defines the common state and behavior of a group of similar object.

2)abstraction is achieved by creating an abstract class and use its objects isa an observable way for a certain functionality

without getting into unnecessary complication encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding which is the

process of hiding all of the secrets of objects that don’t contribute to its essential characteristics which is done by
having private public and protected element in the class

3)object is class instance

4)class function can acces the private members

5)private:

String name;

String account_number;
Int balance;
Public:
Bankaccount(){
Name=” “;
Account_number=”1000’;
Balance=0;
}
Bankaccount(string n,string num,intb{
Name=n;
Account_number=num;
Balance =b;
}
Void display(){
Cout<<”name: “+name+” account number: “+account_number+” balance:”+strg+”;

6) constructors are intake internally used fields ,they may also allocate resources

7) Bankaccount(){

Name=” “;
Account_number=”0”;
Balance=0;
}
8)it’s a constructor that is used to create an object when you don’t provide explicite initialization vale and is called with no arguments
